            Provide an initial assessment:
            - Summarize what the issue is about.
            - Identify which area of the codebase is likely involved.
            - Reference specific files, functions, or modules that are relevant.
            - If bug report: analyze potential root causes based on the code.
            - If feature request: outline where in the codebase changes would
              be needed and any architectural considerations.
            - If question: answer it based on the codebase.
            - Flag any missing information (repro steps, expected vs actual
              behavior, environment).

            Analysis only. Do not modify files. Do not use emojis.
            Be concise and technical. Reference files with path:line format.
