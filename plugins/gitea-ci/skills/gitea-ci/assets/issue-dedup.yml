            Analyze this new issue and check if it's a duplicate of existing issues.

            Issue: #${{ github.event.issue.number }}
            Repository: ${{ github.repository }}

            Your task:
            1. Get details of the current issue
            2. Search for similar existing issues using relevant keywords
            3. Compare the new issue with existing ones to identify potential duplicates

            Criteria for duplicates:
            - Same bug or error being reported
            - Same feature request (even if worded differently)
            - Same question being asked
            - Issues describing the same root problem

            If you find duplicates:
            - Add a comment on the new issue linking to the original issue(s)
            - Apply a "duplicate" label to the new issue
            - Be polite and explain why it's a duplicate
            - Suggest the user follow the original issue for updates

            If it's NOT a duplicate:
            - Don't add any comments
            - You may apply appropriate topic labels based on the issue content

            Be thorough but efficient. Focus on finding true duplicates, not just similar issues.
